## Running 
There are two flavours of the config provided in this code. See below for their differences 

### Local 
Run `make echidna-local`
```yaml 
testMode: assertion # run in assertion mode for a quicker test 
coverage: true # saving coverage  
corpusDir: "output/echidna-corpus" # saving coverage in a directory 
cryticArgs: ["--ignore-compile"] # the contracts do not need to be re-compiled 
testMaxGas: 1250000000  # in preparation for future potentially gas-consuming operations 
codeSize: 0xfffffffffff 
testLimit: 500000 # smaller test limit to sanity check quick 
```

### Cloud 
Run `make echidna-cloud`
```yaml
testMode: exploration # run in exploration mode to increase coverage 
testLimit: 10000000 # number may change, but will increase according to coverage   
coverage: true  # save coverage
corpusDir: "output/echidna-corpus" #save in echidna-corpus directory 
cryticArgs: ["--ignore-compile"] # the contracts do not need to be re-compiled 
```

We use [cloudexec](https://github.com/crytic/cloudexec/tree/hotfix) to run this fuzzing suite on the server. As the release has not been cut yet, see below for installation: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crytic/cloudexec.git
git checkout hotfix 
make
```
Add the binary above to your PATH and you should be able to run cloudexec after sufficient setup.

Run `cloudexec pull ./output` to pull the most recent corpus runs (note that both Echidna and Medusa corpus runs have been changed to write to this directory).
